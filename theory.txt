git -> we will be using for version control
now what is version control
let's say u started to write code for a question. you completed the first part of it
you completed the second part of it. now lets say you were at the third part of it, and u 
messed your entire code and now the first and second part along with the third part wont work
so your only option is to hit the undo key infinite number of times but that not possible and a good 
practice. so using git, you can save your checkpoints. here you could have saved your code upto the second part 
and even you messed up the third part, you could have been able to access your code till second part and you
could have started again.

to initialize git : type git init
